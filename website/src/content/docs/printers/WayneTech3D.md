### Total Hours: 13


- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st
      
---

## Overview:


Desired Specs-

- Wooden plus metal build
- 128x32 oled screen for display or bigger 
- multi-color (maybe)
- raspi 4 or 5 controller
- foldable necessary
- basic control like normal printers(specifically hp m 1005) so that it can print using sd cards or pendrives too.
- possibly a control system from mobile or pc.
 

## Day 1 (13 March, 2025)

Did research on printers and how they work

- I am thinking of using acrylic sheets for base and looks
- Also wood for base(which will make it heavy but it will give a good build too so if hopefully never it gets droped or kicked by mistake it won't get damaged.) and for there areas metal.
- I can also go for full metal build.
- A simple screen for display purpose can be changed into proper control system will be decided according to budget after checking all the parts. I want to keep it as low as possible.
- Did a little bit of researching about 3D printer parts

I want this thing to be able to fit in a small box so I can print whenever I want and keep it aside somewhere.
Main idea is to be able to make a printer more like blot and disassemble or fold the top side.

### Time Elapsed: 2 Hrs


## Day 2 (14 March, 2025)

Did a little more research on printers. Its so confusing and i don't ahve a 3d printer right now.

### Time Elapsed: 1 Hrs

## Day 3 (15 March, 2025)

Today i watched mostly tutorials and made a sketch of what kind of printer i want finally.
It will be a xy printer and bed will go down from up. I want it to be able to fast print. 

### Time Elapsed: 2 Hrs

## Day 3 (16 March, 2025)

 I have decided to make voron printer maybe trident or 0.2 but under 200-300 dollors as it starts from $600. I won't make a 3d model but will use vorons that will be easy to implement.
 

### Time Elapsed: 1 Hrs

## Day 4 (18 March, 2025)

I done research on voron 3d printers and i have decided to make voron trident but still can change that then i might switch to voron 2 which is latest as voron 0 is very small and has some problems. Other voron versions are xz printers. 

I currently do not have any printer so i am trying to minimise as many mistakes as possible. 
Voron works on killper which i belive can work on raspberrypi zero 2 w too that i possess. So for that i am thing of using that. Also i will exclude screen and other parts to reduce pricing. Voron 0 can work if i change its size but then again i want to minimize the errors and problems so i am thinking of using a pre built 3d model from voron.

Tomorrow i will check the 3d models and finalize 1 model. Check the bom files and create one of my own. Move forward with the Project and do some more research.

### Time Elapsed: 3 Hrs

## Day 5 (19 March, 2025)

I installed and run fusion 360 which was really hard to run and was lagging very much. I checked the bom of voron trident and 2.4 but it is incomplete. A lot of items are missing or expensive. I belive if I buy them from local vendors it will be very cheap but i am not sure if they can provide that by the exact specification and cheap. I need to consult with my uncle if it is possible , he buys generally nuts and bolts. 
 

### Time Elapsed: 4 Hrs
